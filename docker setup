-> Containerization

        -> Containerization is one of the practices in devops, which provides 

            -> "Lightweight" and "Efficient" way of running applications 

            -> Promotes "Faster Deployments" and "Portability" for applications

    -> Containerization is implemented by software/tool "DOCKER" 

    -> Docker, the containerization platform which helps 
        simplify application deployment which in turn leads to faster deployments

    -> Container 

        -> A Container holds some supplies / objects, that can be transported 

        -> In terms of software development, a container is an object for 
            holding or transporting/ship applications.

    
    -> Monolithic Architecture

        -> Monolithic architecture is a software design pattern where 
            the entire application is built as a single, indivisible unit.

    -> Microservices Architecture    

        -> Microservices Architecture is a software development approach that involves 
            building small, independent services that work together to create a larger application.

    
    -> Containerization involves packaging an application and its dependencies together 
        into a "lightweight" & "portable" container. 

    -> We as DevOps Engineer, should be able to deploy micro sized applications 
        into micro sized Environments i.e Containers 

            -> Earlier we deployed Applications on Virtual Machines (Heavy Weight Environments)

    -> Docker Architecture

        -> Docker Daemon / Docker Service 
        -> Docker Client [ Docker CLI ]
        -> Docker Registry [ https://hub.docker.com ]
        -> Docker Images
        -> Docker Containers

    -> Flow

        -> Devops Engineer -> Request -> Docker Client(Run Container Nginx) 
            -> Docker Daemon -> Docker Registry -> Nginx Image (Fetched On Server) -> Nginx Container 

    -> The Daemon/Service is responsible for managing Docker objects such as 
        images, containers, and networks. All the heavy lifting is done by daemon.

    -> The client sends commands to the daemon and receives output. 

    -> The registry stores Docker images and allows them to be shared among users and systems.

    -> A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package 
        that includes everything needed to run the desired software application.

    -> A container in Docker allows you to run an application with all the dependencies it needs

    -> NOTE: Terminate LMS Server, once work is done 



-> Setup Docker 

    -> NOTE: Docker Requires, below hardware configuration

        -> AWS 
            
            -> “t2.medium instance” i.e 4 GB RAM - 2 CPU’s on AWS, with 20 GB as Storage.  
                
        -> AZURE 
            
            -> B2S, i.e 4 GB RAM - 2 CPU’s on AZURE, with 30 GB as Storage   

        -> Add Following Rules in Security Groups / Network Security Groups
            -> 22, 80, 32768-61000, 8080-9090

                -> 32768-61000 - Docker Pre defined port range   
                -> 8080-9090 - User defined port range

        -> Setup Docker 

            -> docker 
            -> wget -O get-docker.sh https://get.docker.com && sh get-docker.sh
            -> docker

            -> docker info 
            -> sudo docker info

            -> docker image ls 

            -> To Overcome Permissions issues, add ubuntu(or run command whoami) user to docker group 

                -> sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
                -> logout & login back 
                -> docker image ls 

            -> docker container run hello-world

            -> Devops Engineer -> Request -> Docker Client(Run Container hello-world) 
                -> Docker Daemon -> Docker Registry -> hello-world Image (Fetched On Server) -> hello-world Container
