-> Docker volumes is a mechanism for "persisting data" generated by Docker containers.  

    -> Docker volumes allow data to persist even when containers are deleted. 

    -> Docker Volumes 

        -> Named Volumes controlled by Docker 

            -> Named Volumes are good for fixed data 

            -> -v name_of_volume:/path_container

        -> Host Volumes / Bind Mounts controlled by User    

            -> Host Volumes are good for variable data 

            -> -v /path_host:/path_container

        -> NOTE: With Volumes data is persisted on Host System
