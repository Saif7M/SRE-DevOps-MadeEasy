  rwx       rw-       r--
   |        |         |
  user      group    others


  => check user permissions
      ls -l        -> to check permissions on currecnt directory files
      ls -l /home  -> to check home directory file permissions
      ls -l /      -> to check root level directory/file permissions
      ls -l file.xt  -> to check file permissions

  => 3 commands used for permissions
      chmod  chown  chgrp

    -> Set file to readonly permissions
    Format: chmod u-w filename      -> removing write permissions for user
        ex: chmod u-w file.txt

        chmod ugo-rwx file.txt      -> this will remove all read, write and execute permissions for file.txt file for all users, group and others.
        output: :  ~$ ls -l file.txt
                  ---------- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 0 Nov 19 06:54 file.txt

        ex: chmod ugo+r file.txt                -> this will add read permissions for ugo
        output: ubuntu@ip-172-31-31-217:~$ ls -l file.txt
                -r--r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 0 Nov 19 06:54 file.txt


  => two types of chmod permissions
    1.Symbolic mode
      rwx  -> read write execute
      ugo  ->  user group others
      +-   -> add(+) and remove(-)


    2.Numberic Mode    - user numbers for permissions
      
      Better explaination: https://www.booleanworld.com/introduction-linux-file-permissions/

      Number	rwx triplet     	Description
      0	      ---	              No permissions
      1	      --x	              Execute
      2	      -w-	              Write
      3	      -wx	              Write and execute
      4	      r--	              Read
      5	      r-x	              Read and execute
      6	      rw-	              Read and write
      7	      rwx	              Read, write and execute


    => set file permissiions to read and write using numberic mode
      ex: chmod 666 file.txt
  
          chmod 777 file.txt
      output: ls -l file.txt
              -rwxrwxrwx 1 ubuntu ubuntu 0 Nov 19 06:54 file.txt      -> now set permissions with read, write and execute

    => Changing owernership - chown

        Format: sudo chown owner filename/directoryname
            ex: sudo chown ubuntu /opt/file.txt            -> now ubuntu has permissios of owner rather than root

        

    => Changing group - chgrp    
        ex: sudo chgrp ubuntu /opt/file.txt      

    => steps to change ownership of file

      sudo vi /opt/db.properties   -> add content to file
      ls -l /opt/db.properties     -> check permissions

      sudo chgrp developers /opt/db.properties  -> group changed to developers and no more ubuntu group can access file
      ls -l /opt/db.properties     -> check permissions

      sudo chmod 440 /opt/db.properties         -> user and group can only read files
      ls -l /opt/db.properties     -> check permissions

Note: try downloading executable file and execute it

    -> exectue permission
      chmod u+x kubectl  -> make kubectl as executable file
      ./kubectl          -> run to execute


  => Creted shell script file and run it
      buntu@ip-172-31-31-217:~$ touch kube.sh    -> created file with .sh extention
      ubuntu@ip-172-31-31-217:~$ vim kube.sh     -> edit file and echo command with some text
      ubuntu@ip-172-31-31-217:~$ ./kube.sh       -> try running/executing file - it gave error
      -bash: ./kube.sh: Permission denied
      ubuntu@ip-172-31-31-217:~$ chmod u+x kube.sh       -> make file executable
      ubuntu@ip-172-31-31-217:~$ ./kube.sh               -> try run and got output
      myfirst file
