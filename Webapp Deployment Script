-> Shell Scripting

        -> Shell scripting is a way to automate tasks on a server 
            by writing a series of commands in a file.
            This file, called a script, is then executed.

        -> A shell script is a text file containing a sequence of commands 
            that the shell(bash) can interpret and execute. 
            These commands can include anything from simple file operations 
            to complex system administration tasks.
        
        -> Automating repetitive tasks is the most common use case.
