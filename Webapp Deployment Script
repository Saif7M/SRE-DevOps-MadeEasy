-> Shell Scripting

        -> Shell scripting is a way to automate tasks on a server 
            by writing a series of commands in a file.
            This file, called a script, is then executed.

        -> A shell script is a text file containing a sequence of commands 
            that the shell(bash) can interpret and execute. 
            These commands can include anything from simple file operations 
            to complex system administration tasks.
        
        -> Automating repetitive tasks is the most common use case.

-> Git CLI Workflow 

        git clone <url>
        cd repository
        git status
        git branch
        git config --global user.name ravi2krishna                   
        git config --global user.email ravi2krishna@gmail.com
        git branch	 scripts
        git branch
        git checkout scripts
        git branch
        git status
        vi script.sh   
            { put some content }               
        git status
        git add script.sh   
            { staged the changes }
        git commit -m "Create Deployment Script"    
            { Committed from staging area to local repo}
        git status
        git push --all

 -> Static Code Analysis - SCA 

        -> Static code analysis is the "process" of examining source code, bytecode, or binary code 
        without executing it to find potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, and quality issues. 
        Automated tools scan the code against predefined rules 
        to identify problems early in the development cycle, 
        promoting better coding practices and security. 

        -> Static code analysis is the PROCESS of analysing source code without actually executing it. 

        -> It involves examining the code for potential issues, 
            vulnerabilities, and adherence to coding standards and best practices. 
        
        -> Static code analysis can help identify various types of issues, including:

                Syntax errors and typos
                Unused variables and methods
                Code duplication
                Security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting)
                Memory leaks and resource leaks
                Performance issues
                Conformance to coding standards and style guidelines (e.g., indentation, naming conventions)

        -> NOTE: Later on we as DevOps Engineers will write Automated CI-CD Pipelines,
                    in which SCA is one of the checks / steps 

    -> To implement SCA we use Tool "SonarQube"

    -> SonarQube 

        -> SonarQube is an open-source platform for continuous code quality and security analysis 
            that helps developers identify bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells in their code. 
            It integrates with CI/CD pipelines.

        -> SonarQube Requires Following Hardware Configuration
        
            -> AWS 
            
                -> “t2.medium instance” i.e 4 GB RAM - 2 CPU’s on AWS, with 20 GB as Storage.  
                
            -> AZURE 
            
                -> B2S, i.e 4 GB RAM - 2 CPU’s on AZURE, with 30 GB as Storage
                
            -> NOTE: Charges Applicable i.e 4 INR per hour

            -> NOTE: SonarQube works on “port 9000”

                -> Make sure to add port 9000 as part of your Security Group or Network Security Group


        -> To Install SonarQube Will Rely on Docker Tool (Docker is for Fastness)

            -> Without Docker - https://github.com/saif7m/sonarqube-installation-guide.git - 45 mins 

            -> With Docker - 5 mins
