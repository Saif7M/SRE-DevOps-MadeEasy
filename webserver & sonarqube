    -> Web Server 

        -> A web server is computer software [ Nginx HTTP Server ] 
        and underlying hardware [ AWS Instance / AZURE VM ] 
        that accepts requests via HTTP (port 80) 
        to distribute web content.

        -> NOTE: All Servers that host websites must have web server program.

            -> sudo apt install nginx -y 
            -> sudo ss -ntpl (check for port 80)

            -> Browse Pubic IP 

        -> For Web Servers, we have DocumentRoot i.e location 
            where web pages load from /var/www/html 

            -> ls /var/www/html

                -> sudo git clone https://github.com/saif7m/login-2519.git /var/www/html 

                -> sudo rm /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html

                -> ls /var/www/html
