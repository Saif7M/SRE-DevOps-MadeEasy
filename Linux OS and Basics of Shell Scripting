The Linux OS is a layered architecture comprising the hardware, kernel, system libraries, system utilities, and the shell. 
The kernel is the core component that communicates directly with the hardware to manage system resources like memory and the CPU.
The shell is the user interface, which takes commands and uses system libraries and utilities to translate them into actions for the kernel to execute. 


=== Architecture layers ====
Hardware Layer: The physical components of the computer, including the CPU, memory (RAM), and storage devices.

Kernel: The core of the OS, which manages hardware resources and acts as the bridge between the hardware and software. It handles processes, memory, and file management.

System Libraries: These are collections of functions that applications use to access kernel functions, often translating them into system calls that the kernel can understand.

System Utilities: Programs that perform specialized tasks and provide services to users, such as managing files and system resources.

Shell: The user interface, which can be a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI). The shell accepts commands,
passes them to the kernel via system calls, and displays the results. 


Linux commands for users and permissions:

---> how to check user exist
    id user     -to check user exit or not and check details.
    ex: id ubuntu
        id khaja
        id root


----> whoami - to check current user

----> check all users in linux system
      cat /ect/passwd

----> switch user accounts
        sudo su - username

    ex: sudo su - root
        sudo su - sys #this account currently not avaialable
        sudo su - bin  #this account currenlty not avaialable

        logout -> to come out of current user, here root user
Note: above users sys and bin are system users and they don't have bin/bash so login

--->  Create users / add user account(required sudo as it is system level change)

      sudo adduser username
    ex: sudo adduser john

    confirm: id john

Note: id number less than 1000 are system users and above are normal user human entity.

    To find the exact account information - grep used to find "saif" string
---> cat /etc/passwd | grep saif

---> Grant regular user from outside the server

    ->AWS -> sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/60-cloudimag-settings.conf
    ->set passwordauthontication to yes
    ->restart: sudo systemctl restart ssh

    ->Azure -> sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-cloudimg-init.conf
