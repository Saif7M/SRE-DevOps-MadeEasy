The Linux OS is a layered architecture comprising the hardware, kernel, system libraries, system utilities, and the shell. 
The kernel is the core component that communicates directly with the hardware to manage system resources like memory and the CPU.
The shell is the user interface, which takes commands and uses system libraries and utilities to translate them into actions for the kernel to execute. 


=== Architecture layers ====
Hardware Layer: The physical components of the computer, including the CPU, memory (RAM), and storage devices.

Kernel: The core of the OS, which manages hardware resources and acts as the bridge between the hardware and software. It handles processes, memory, and file management.

System Libraries: These are collections of functions that applications use to access kernel functions, often translating them into system calls that the kernel can understand.

System Utilities: Programs that perform specialized tasks and provide services to users, such as managing files and system resources.

Shell: The user interface, which can be a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI). The shell accepts commands,
passes them to the kernel via system calls, and displays the results.
