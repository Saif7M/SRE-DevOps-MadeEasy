SDLC 

        -> The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process followed by 
            software development teams to design, develop and test high-quality software. 

        -> The SDLC consists of multiple stages such as Requirement Gathering, Analysis, Design, 
            Code, Test, Deploy and Maintain.

    -> Version Control Systems (VCS)

        -> Version control / Revision control / Source control is a process that helps to 
            keep track of changes made to a file or a set of files 
            (computer programs, web site files, documents etc) over time.

        -> Advantage Of VCS is Revert Changes To Previous Working Versions, 
            if there are issues in new version

Client Side Software     - Developer 

            -> Git a tool to implement VSC 
            -> Git helps in tracking code / changes in your code 
            -> Git tracks code in your laptop 

        -> GitHub - Server Side Software  - Organizations

            -> GitHub provides a platform to store code 
            -> GitHub Stores All Versions Of Code in centralized location (github.com)

        -> Developer -> Git -> GitHub 

        -> Repository 

            -> A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. 
                Developers can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.

        -> JIRA 

            -> Jira is a proprietary product developed by Atlassian that allows 
                bug tracking, issue tracking and agile project management. 
        

  repository owner -> organization or person who created repo and has owner access.

  note: by defualt we get branch called "main"

  => Branch Protection: Developer will clone main branch from github repo and create dev branch(experimental copy of main branch) locally and work on it and create PR.

=> Terminology:
    1. Branches
      Branching is a core concept in Git where a separate line of development is created, allowing developers to work on different features, fixes, or experiments simultaneously without affecting the main codebase.
      Common branch types include:
      Main (Master) Branch: The primary and stable branch, often used for production-ready code.
      Feature Branches: Created for developing new features. These branches are typically merged back into the main branch after the work is completed.
      Hotfix Branches: Used to fix bugs in the main branch, especially in production.
      Release Branches: Created to prepare for a new release, allowing final touches, testing, and bug fixes before merging into the main branch.
      
    2. Commits
      A commit in Git is a snapshot of changes made to the code. Each commit records who made the change, what was changed, and when.
      Commits should be small, focused, and meaningful, allowing easy tracking and rollback if necessary.
      
    3. Merging
      Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another.
      Merges can be:
      Fast-forward: When there is no divergence, and the target branch simply moves forward to the tip of the merged branch.
      Three-way merge: When there are divergent changes, Git creates a new commit that combines the changes.
      Merge conflicts occur when changes in different branches are incompatible, requiring manual resolution.
      
    4. Pull Requests (PR)
      A Pull Request is a feature offered by platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, where developers can request to merge their branch into another (usually the main branch).
      PRs allow for code review, discussion, and testing before merging, ensuring code quality and minimising bugs.
      
    5. Rebasing
      Rebasing is another way to integrate changes from one branch into another.
      Instead of creating a merge commit, rebasing re-applies commits from one branch onto another as if they were created sequentially, resulting in a linear history.
      
    6. Staging Area
      The staging area is where changes are reviewed and prepared before committing. This allows developers to control exactly what gets included in a commit.
      
=> Common Git Workflows
      1. Centralised Workflow
      Single Branch (Master/Main): Everyone works directly on the main branch.
      Usage: Simple projects or small teams.
      Pros: Easy to understand.
      Cons: High risk of conflicts, less control over changes.
      
      2. Feature Branch Workflow
      Branches: Each feature or bug fix is developed in its own branch.
      Usage: Medium to large teams.
      Pros: Isolated development, easier collaboration, and safer code integration.
      Cons: Requires good branch management.
      
      3. Gitflow Workflow
      Branches: Includes main, develop, feature, release, and hotfix branches.
      Usage: Complex projects with multiple release cycles.
      Pros: Structured release management, clear branch roles.
      Cons: Complex branch management, not ideal for continuous deployment.
      
      4. Forking Workflow
      Fork: Each developer has a personal copy (fork) of the repository.
      Usage: Open-source projects or teams working on the same base code but needing different variations.
      Pros: Complete isolation, contributors can experiment freely.
      Cons: More complex collaboration, harder to manage multiple forks.

        Note: large organization uses feature branch workflow.

=> Terminology:
    1. Owner
      The Owner is the person who owns the repository, often responsible for setting up the project, managing permissions, and overseeing the overall codebase.
      The owner creates the repository and can add other developers as collaborators.
      
    2. Repository
      A Repository (repo) is a storage location for your project. It contains all the files and their version history.
      The repository is hosted on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, enabling multiple developers to work on the project.
      
    3. Main Branch
      The Main Branch (often named main or master) is the primary branch in a repository.
      It contains the stable and production-ready code that should always be in a deployable state.
      Changes to the main branch are carefully managed and reviewed to ensure stability.
      
    4. Protect Main Branch
      The owner can Protect the Main Branch to prevent direct pushes or unreviewed changes. This means:
      Only certain users can make changes.
      Changes can only be made via Pull Requests (PRs) that must be reviewed and approved.
      Protection rules can include:
      Requiring status checks to pass before merging.
      Restricting who can push to the branch.
      
    5. Developer
      A Developer is someone working on the project. They are given access to the repository by the owner.
      Developers do not work directly on the main branch; instead, they create feature branches to work on new features, bug fixes, or other tasks.
      
    6. Dev Branch
      The Dev Branch (or any feature branch) is created by the developer from the main branch.
      This branch is where the developer writes code, commits changes, and tests new features.
      The dev branch is often named after the feature or bug being addressed, e.g., feature/login-page or bugfix/header-issue.
      
    7. Pull Request by Developer from Dev to Main Branch
      Once the developer is satisfied with their changes, they open a Pull Request (PR).
      The PR is a request to merge the changes from the dev branch into the main branch.
      The PR contains a description of the changes, and any relevant information the owner/reviewers need to know.
      
    8. Owner Review and Merge to Main Branch
      The Owner (or other reviewers) reviews the Pull Request.
      They may check:
      Code quality and style.
      If the changes introduce any bugs or issues.
      Whether the changes align with the project goals.
      The reviewer can request changes, approve, or reject the PR.
      Once approved, the owner or authorized reviewer merges the dev branch into the main branch.
      After merging, the main branch is updated with the new changes, and the dev branch can be deleted if it’s no longer needed.
      
      
  => Summary of the Workflow:
      Owner creates and manages the Repository.
      The Main Branch is protected to ensure stability.
      A Developer creates a Dev Branch to work on new features or fixes.
      The developer opens a Pull Request to merge changes from the dev branch to the main branch.
      The Owner reviews the changes, and upon approval, merges them into the Main Branch.
