-> LMS Application Deployment - 2 Hours 

    -> Terminate Server 
    
    -> Again Redeploy LMS Application - 2 Hours 

    -> DevOps Engineer will implement "DevOps Practices" using "TOOLS"
            so that organizations can BUILD, TEST & DEPLOY (Delivery Line) Softwares
            "FASTER" & "RELIABLE"

    -> every time taking 2 hours, its time consuming so as a devops engineer how can we do it FASTER ?? ---> project-2.

    -> Project - 1 (LMS App Deployment) Helped us understand, 
        how real world apps will be deployed

    -> Project - 2 (How To Accelerate Things i.e FASTER )

        -> LMS Application Deployment - 2 Hours (Normal Approach)

        -> LMS Application Deployment - 2 mins (Containerized Approach)

    -> Containerization

        -> Containerization is one of the practices in devops, which provides 

            -> "Lightweight" and "Efficient" way of running applications 

            -> Promotes "Faster Deployments" and "Portability" for applications

    -> Containerization is implemented by software/tool "DOCKER" 


-> Monolithic Architecture

        -> Monolithic architecture is a software design pattern where 
            the entire application is built as a single, indivisible unit.

    -> Microservices Architecture    

        -> Microservices Architecture is a software development approach that involves 
            building small, independent services that work together to create a larger application.

    
    -> Containerization involves packaging an application and its dependencies together 
        into a "lightweight" & "portable" container. 

    -> We as DevOps Engineer, should be able to deploy micro sized applications 
        into micro sized Environments i.e Containers 

            -> Earlier we deployed Applications on Virtual Machines (Heavy Weight Environments)

    -> Docker Architecture

        -> Docker Daemon / Docker Service 
        -> Docker Client [ Docker CLI ]
        -> Docker Registry [ https://hub.docker.com ]
        -> Docker Images
        -> Docker Containers

    -> Flow

        -> Devops Engineer -> Request -> Docker Client(Run Container Nginx) 
            -> Docker Daemon -> Docker Registry -> Nginx Image (Fetched On Server) -> Nginx Container 

    -> The Daemon/Service is responsible for managing Docker objects such as 
        images, containers, and networks. All the heavy lifting is done by daemon.

    -> The client sends commands to the daemon and receives output. 

    -> The registry stores Docker images and allows them to be shared among users and systems.

    -> A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package 
        that includes everything needed to run the desired software application.

    -> A container in Docker allows you to run an application with all the dependencies it needs

    -> NOTE: Terminate LMS Server, once work is done 


    -> Docker, the containerization platform which helps 
        simplify application deployment which in turn leads to faster deployments

    -> Container 

        -> A Container holds some supplies / objects, that can be transported 

        -> In terms of software development, a container is an object for 
            holding or transporting/ship applications.
