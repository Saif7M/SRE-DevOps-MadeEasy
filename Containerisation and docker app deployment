-> LMS Application Deployment - 2 Hours 

    -> Terminate Server 
    
    -> Again Redeploy LMS Application - 2 Hours 

    -> DevOps Engineer will implement "DevOps Practices" using "TOOLS"
            so that organizations can BUILD, TEST & DEPLOY (Delivery Line) Softwares
            "FASTER" & "RELIABLE"

    -> FASTER ?? 

    -> Project - 1 (LMS App Deployment) Helped us understand, 
        how real world apps will be deployed

    -> Project - 2 (How To Accelerate Things i.e FASTER )

        -> LMS Application Deployment - 2 Hours (Normal Approach)

        -> LMS Application Deployment - 2 mins (Containerized Approach)

    -> Containerization

        -> Containerization is one of the practices in devops, which provides 

            -> "Lightweight" and "Efficient" way of running applications 

            -> Promotes "Faster Deployments" and "Portability" for applications

    -> Containerization is implemented by software/tool "DOCKER" 

    -> Docker, the containerization platform which helps 
        simplify application deployment which in turn leads to faster deployments

    -> Container 

        -> A Container holds some supplies / objects, that can be transported 

        -> In terms of software development, a container is an object for 
            holding or transporting/ship applications.
