-> Build Management 

        -> The term "build" may refer to the "process" by which 
            "source code" is converted into "binary code" (software artifact)

        -> In DevOps, the software build process is a foundational component of the 
            Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, 
            serving as a critical automated step that transforms 
            source code into a deployable product.

                -> Artifact is Useable Software after build is done 

        -> Source Code - https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/tags

                -> After Building, Artifact is Useable Software which is below 

        -> Binary Code - https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/

-> Any Build implementation consists of following steps 

        -> Source Code Files 

            -> Source code is the list of human-readable instructions that a programmer writes

            -> Handled by Developer

        -> Metadata File 

            -> File that contains information about the project and 
                configuration details used to build the project. 

            -> Handled by Developer

        -> Binary Code (After Build is done)

            -> Build artifacts are files produced by a build

            -> Handled by Developer in his Laptop
            
            -> Handled by DevOps Engineer on Server for future Automation in CI-CD

        
    -> NOTE: Below Link Help's you understand, how developers initially learn how to perform builds

============================
-> Three Tier App Architecture

        -> Most Popular Applications
            
            -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_languages_used_in_most_popular_websites

        -> LMS Application Stack
            
            -> Database: POSTGRES
            -> Backend: NODEJS 
            -> Frontend: JavaScript (REACTJS)

    -> LMS Project - BUILD 
        
        -> As LMS App is multi tier, We need Following Rules(ports) in Security Group
            -> SSH - 22 - Login
            -> DATABASE TIER [ POSTGRES ] - 5432 - Storing Data
            -> APPLICATION TIER [ NODEJS ] - 8080 - Business Logics
            -> FRONTEND TIER [ REACTJS ] - 80 - Hosted On Web Server

    -> NOTE: LMS Application Build Requires, below hardware configuration

        -> AWS 
            
            -> “t2.medium instance” i.e 4 GB RAM - 2 CPU’s on AWS, with 20 GB as Storage.  
                
        -> AZURE 
            
            -> B2S, i.e 4 GB RAM - 2 CPU’s on AZURE, with 30 GB as Storage
