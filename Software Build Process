-> Build Management 

        -> The term "build" may refer to the "process" by which 
            "source code" is converted into "binary code" (software artifact)

        -> In DevOps, the software build process is a foundational component of the 
            Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, 
            serving as a critical automated step that transforms 
            source code into a deployable product.
