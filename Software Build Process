-> Build Management 

        -> The term "build" may refer to the "process" by which 
            "source code" is converted into "binary code" (software artifact)

        -> In DevOps, the software build process is a foundational component of the 
            Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, 
            serving as a critical automated step that transforms 
            source code into a deployable product.

                -> Artifact is Useable Software after build is done

                -> After Building, Artifact is Useable Software which is below 

        -> Binary Code - https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/

-> Any Build implementation consists of following steps 

        -> Source Code Files 

            -> Source code is the list of human-readable instructions that a programmer writes

            -> Handled by Developer

        -> Metadata File 

            -> File that contains information about the project and 
                configuration details used to build the project. 

            -> Handled by Developer

        -> Binary Code (After Build is done)

            -> Build artifacts are files produced by a build

            -> Handled by Developer in his Laptop
            
            -> Handled by DevOps Engineer on Server for future Automation in CI-CD
